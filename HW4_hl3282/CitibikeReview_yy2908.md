# From Yaxuan Yin,yy2908: 

a.Validation：
Null hypotheses：The proportion of suscriber biking on weekends is the same or higher than the proportion of customer biking on weekends.
Alternative hypotheses：The proportion of suscriber biking on weekends is lower than the proportion of customer biking on weekends.

b. The data supports the project: 
Droping the useless columns is nice but it is better to divide the data into workdays and weekends.

c.Suggestion
You could use Z test, T test,Chi square test as statistical test method.
Z-tests focus on a single parameter, and treat all other unknown parameters as being fixed at their true values. The test statistic meets a normal distribution as well.After data cleaning, we have two types of people using citi-bikes and two different time range. The hypothesis aims to compare the portion of these two people of citi-bike rider number in weekends. We always use Z-test to compare that.
T-test is most commonly applied when the test statistic would follow a normal distribution if the value of a scaling term in the test statistic were known.
The chi-squared test is any statistical hypothesis test where the sampling distribution of the test statistic is a chi-squared distribution when the null hypothesis is true. And it is used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the expected frequencies and the observed frequencies in one or more categories.
